# **Part 1. Cybersecurity Scenario**
## Threat Intelligence Report
### Types of Attacks:
 - **SQL Injection:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in web applications to execute malicious SQL statements.
 - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
 - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers execute arbitrary code on a server due to vulnerabilities.
 - **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** Attackers intercept and alter communication between two parties.
### Exploiting Vulnerabilities:
A vulnerability in a web application can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the network by:
 - **Injecting Malicious Code:** Attackers can inject code that executes on the server, giving them control over the application.
 - **Escalating Privileges:** Once inside, attackers can escalate their privileges to gain broader access to the network.
 - **Exfiltrating Data:** Attackers can steal sensitive data from the network.
### Preventive Measures
 - **Regular Patching:** Ensure all software and applications are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
 - **Web Application Firewalls (WAF):** Deploy WAFs to filter and monitor HTTP requests.
 - **Code Reviews:** Conduct regular code reviews to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
 - **Security Training:** Provide ongoing security training for developers and staff.
### Azure Resources Affected
 - **Virtual Machines (VMs):** Virtual servers running applications.
 - **Azure SQL Databases:** Managed relational databases.
 - **Blob Storage:** Storage for data and files.
 - **Azure Functions:** Serverless compute services.
## Incident Response Plan
### Containment
 - **Isolate Affected Systems:** Use Azure Network Security Groups to isolate compromised VMs.
 - **Block Malicious IPs:** Update Azure WAF rules to block IP addresses involved in the attack.
### Eradication
 - **Remove Malicious Code:** Identify and remove any injected malicious code from applications.
 - **Revoke Compromised Credentials:** Rotate and revoke any compromised Azure Active Directory (AD) credentials.
### Recovery
 - **Restore from Backups:** Use Azure Backup to restore affected systems to a known good state.
 - **Monitor for Recurrence:** Implement Azure Monitor to track for any signs of recurring attacks.
### Azure Services and Features
 - **Azure Security Center:** Continuous threat detection and monitoring.
 - **Azure Activity Log:** Logs API calls for auditing and investigation.
 - **Azure Policy:** Tracks configuration changes and compliance.
## Network Security Measures
### Recommended Measures
 - **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Use Azure Firewall to detect and prevent malicious traffic.
 - **Firewalls:** Implement Azure WAF to protect web applications from common exploits.
 - **Network Segmentation:** Use Azure Virtual Network (VNet) to segment the network and limit lateral movement.
### Security Technologies and Practices
 - **Azure DDoS Protection:** Safeguard against large-scale attacks.
 - **Azure Active Directory (AD):** Manage user access and permissions securely.
 - **Azure Key Vault:** Encrypt data at rest and in transit.
# **Part 2. Container Security Implementation**
## Docker Security Best Practices
### Best Practices
 - **Use Official Images:** Always use official images from trusted sources to minimize the risk of vulnerabilities.
 - **Run Containers as Non-Root Users:** Avoid running containers as the root user to limit the impact of a potential compromise.
 - **Keep Docker Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Docker to the latest version to benefit from security patches and improvements.
 - **Scan Images for Vulnerabilities:** Use tools like Docker Bench or Clair to scan images for known vulnerabilities.
 - **Limit Container Capabilities:** Use Docker’s capability options to restrict the capabilities of containers, reducing the attack surface.
### Dockerfile Implementation
Here’s an example Dockerfile that implements the practice of running containers as non-root users:

	# Use an official image as a base
	FROM node:14

	# Create a non-root user
	RUN useradd -m appuser

	# Set the user to the non-root user
	USER appuser

	# Set the working directory
	WORKDIR /app

	# Copy the application code
	COPY . .

	# Install dependencies
	RUN npm install

	# Expose the application port
	EXPOSE 3000

	# Start the application
	CMD ["node", "app.js"]

## Kubernetes Security Configuration
### Kubernetes Security Features
 - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** RBAC allows you to define and enforce access policies for users and applications, ensuring that only authorized entities can perform specific actions.
 - **Network Policies:** Network policies enable you to control the communication between pods and services, restricting traffic to only what is necessary.
 - **Pod Security Policies (PSP):** PSPs define a set of conditions that a pod must meet to be accepted into the cluster, such as running as a non-root user or using specific security contexts.
### Kubernetes YAML Configuration
Here’s an example YAML configuration that includes `securityContext` settings for a pod:

	apiVersion: v1
	kind: Pod
	metadata:
	  name: secure-pod
	spec:
	  containers:
	  - name: secure-container
	    image: nginx:latest
	    securityContext:
	      runAsUser: 1000
	      runAsGroup: 3000
	      fsGroup: 2000
	      capabilities:
	        drop:
	        - ALL
	      readOnlyRootFilesystem: true

## IaaS Security Measures
### Concept of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud computing model that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. IaaS allows organizations to rent infrastructure components such as servers, storage, and networking on a pay-as-you-go basis. This model offers flexibility, scalability, and cost savings, but also introduces security implications.

### Security Implications
 - **Shared Responsibility Model:** In IaaS, security is a shared responsibility between the cloud provider and the customer. The provider is responsible for securing the underlying infrastructure, while the customer is responsible for securing their applications, data, and configurations.
 - **Data Protection:** Customers must ensure that their data is encrypted both at rest and in transit to protect against unauthorized access.
 - **Access Control:** Implementing strong access control measures, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and least privilege principles, is crucial to prevent unauthorized access to resources.
